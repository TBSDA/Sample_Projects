# Sample Projects

Here some sample projects can be found.

# 1 Healthcare Stroke Prediction Model
  Project shows the steps of building the prediction model using machine learning. 
  The main notebook is Stroke_Prediction_Model. The rest of them show the steps which led to build up the final model, e.g. feature selection, data cleansing, models research and so on.
  
    Used libraries:
      - pandas
      - numpy
      - seaborn
      - matplotlib
      - sklearn
      - scipy
      - imblearn
      - other (like math, itertools)
  
    Used skills:
      - fundamental statistical knowledge
      - exploratory data analysis
      - data cleansing
      - data preprocessing
      - data visualization
      - data presentation
      - building pipelines for data processing
      - building custom class based on existing ones
      - metric choosing
      - imbalanced dataset adjustment (resampling techniques)
      - classification models research (like linear, gradient descent, tree based, outlier detection)
      - hyperparameter tuning

# 2 Mental Health in the Tech Industry Analysis
  Project shows the path of building the script for data presentation and visualization based on SQL database.
  The main notebook is Data_Presenting. The rest of them are the steps that led to create the main one.

# 3 TA Signals
  Project shows the components and final script which can be used for finding technical analysis for tickers/companies within supported indexes.
  The script can be improve by adding new indexes and new signals.
  The main notebook is TA_Signal_Finder. Rest of them are the components which are included in main notebook.
  
    Used libraries:
      - pandas
      - numpy

      - requests
      - bs4
      - other (like re, os, sys)
  
    Used skills:
      - data gathering (directly from web and via API)
      - data processing
      - data analysis
      - building algorithms
      - building class and functions
